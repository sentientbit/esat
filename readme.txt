=== Description (English) ===

*ESAT* is a very light plugin that extends the functionalities for your site and plugins. Easily enable features and enhancements that normally require multiple plugins. Deactivating this plugin brings your site back exactly to the state it was before activation and making settings.

== Features ==

= Security =
- Hide default login page (wp-admin.php) by easily and safely changing the URL to anything you want. It doesnâ€™t literally rename or change files in core, nor does it add rewrite rules. It simply intercepts page requests and works on any WordPress website. The wp-admin directory and wp-login.php page become inaccessible, so you should bookmark or remember the url.

= Customization =
- Customize login page.
